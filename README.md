An exercise in git commit conflicts are terrible poetry

### Instructions

There's an incomplete poem on the master branch under the file `poem.md`. There are two branches, `version-a` and `version-b`, both pushed to origin.

Merge `version-a` to master branch, then merge `version-b` to master branch. What happens?
